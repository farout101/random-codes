Explore at your leisure, focusing on the panoramic views from pagodas like Soon U Ponya Shin Pagoda. The peaceful atmosphere and stunning scenery offer a relaxing escape.\n    *   *Opening Hours:* Many pagodas are open from early morning to late afternoon. Sagaing Hill itself is accessible from 7:00 AM - 7:30 PM.\n    *   *Cost:* Many smaller pagodas are free.

Take a leisurely walk across the 1.2-kilometer bridge and soak in the serene atmosphere as the sun dips below the horizon, casting beautiful colors over Taungthaman Lake. This is a perfect relaxing and photogenic end to your day. Sunset in November is around 5:25 PM.\n    *   *Cost:* Free.\n    *   *Location:* Amarapura.\n\n*   **7:00 PM onwards: Dinner in Amarapura or Return to Mandalay**\n    Enjoy an affordable dinner at a local restaurant near U Bein Bridge or head back to Mandalay for more dining options.\n\n---"

Lisbon is a fantastic choice for both!\n\nLet's start with Day 1. How does this sound for your first day in Lisbon?\n\n### **Day 1: Age of Discovery & Alfama Charm**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM - 1:00 PM): Belém's Historic Treasures**\n    Start your day in the historic Belém district, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a testament to Portugal's Age of Discovery.\n    *   **Jerónimos Monastery (Mosteiro dos Jerónimos):** Explore this magnificent example of Manueline architecture, admiring its intricate cloisters and grand church. It houses the tomb of Vasco da Gama.\n    *   **Belém Tower (Torre de Belém):** A 16th-century fortification that once guarded Lisbon's harbor. You can admire its unique Manueline style from the outside and enjoy views of the Tagus River.\n    *   **Pastéis de Belém:** Indulge in the original, warm custard tarts at the iconic Pastéis de Belém bakery, whose secret recipe has remained unchanged since 1837.\n\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM): Authentic Portuguese Bites**\n    Grab a traditional Portuguese lunch in the Belém area. Perhaps try a \"Bifana,\" a delicious pork sandwich, or \"Pastéis de Bacalhau\" (fried codfish cakes).\n\n*   **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 6:30 PM): Alfama's Medieval Labyrinth**\n    Head to the oldest district of Lisbon, Alfama, known for its narrow, winding streets and medieval charm.\n    *   **São Jorge Castle (Castelo de São Jorge):** Explore this ancient Moorish castle perched atop a hill, offering panoramic views of the city's red rooftops and the Tagus River.\n    *   **Wander through Alfama:** Get lost in the labyrinthine alleys, discover hidden viewpoints (miradouros), and soak in the historic atmosphere.\n\n*   **Evening (7:00 PM onwards): Traditional Flavors & Fado**\n    Enjoy a traditional Portuguese dinner in the Alfama district. You could try \"Bacalhau à Brás\" (shredded cod with potatoes and eggs) or \"Sardinhas Assadas\" (grilled sardines, especially popular in summer). If you're interested, consider finding a restaurant that offers a Fado performance, Lisbon's soulful traditional music.\n\nHow does this first day sound to you? We can adjust anything you like!"
